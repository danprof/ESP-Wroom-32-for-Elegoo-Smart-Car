#ESP-Wroom-32-for-Elegoo-Smart-Car

Project to add an ESP32S to Elegoo Smart Car as a controller.
The ESP has an LCD display and a 5 button keyboard to allow user to select a mode of operation and/or set preferences stored in SRAM.

The many available GPIO pins allow  for easy interfacing of the LCD, the keyboard, a paasive buzzer, and allows for future expansion with
a variety of other sensors.
